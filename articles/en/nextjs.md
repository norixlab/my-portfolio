## What is Next.js?

[Next.js](https://nextjs.org) is a popular framework for React application development that provides powerful capabilities for building modern websites and applications. Its main feature is the flexibility in choosing the rendering approach: from server-side rendering (SSR) and static generation (SSG) to client-side rendering (CSR).

## Why am I using Next.js?

This framework provides powerful tools that speed up the development process and allow you to create fast and scalable solutions. Here are a few key benefits of Next.js:

#### 1\. **Server-side rendering (SSR) and static generation (SSG)**

[Next.js](https://nextjs.org) supports both server-side rendering (SSR) and static generation (SSG) to significantly improve application performance. Static generation allows pages to be pre-rendered on the server, making page loading instantaneous for the user. This is particularly useful for SEO, as search engines can efficiently index page content without the need to execute JavaScript.

#### 2\. **Performance Optimization**

Automatically performs many performance optimizations such as code splitting and resource preloading. This ensures that users get instant access to the data and content they need without unnecessary delay, and developers don't have to spend time manually configuring these processes.

#### 3\. **Reactivity and client-side rendering**

It integrates perfectly with React to create dynamic and responsive interfaces. It is ideal for SPA (single page application) development when you need to take advantage of the client for dynamic updates such as user interaction or asynchronous data loading.

#### 4\. **Support for API routes**

In Next.js, you can easily create API routes, which simplifies the development of server-side logic within the same application. This is useful for developing server-side functions such as form processing, authentication, database handling, etc., without the need for a separate server.

#### 5\. **Flexibility and choice of rendering**

Allows you to select the appropriate rendering method for each page: static generation, server-side rendering, or client-side rendering. This gives flexibility depending on the specific content and performance requirements.

#### 6\. **Ready-made routing system**

In Next.js using App Router, the routing system is based on the file structure of the `app` folder. Each folder within `app` automatically becomes a route, and files such as `page.jsx/.tsx` define the contents of the pages. This simplifies code organization and makes it easy to create nested routes and dynamic paths, speeding up the development process without the need to manually configure routing.

#### 7\. **Full integration with TypeScript**

Next.js has built-in TypeScript support, allowing you to use static typing for safer development and improved code quality. This is especially important when working in teams and developing large applications.

#### 8\. **Scalability and ease of deployment**

Easily scales for both small projects and large applications. It can be deployed on various platforms such as [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/), [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and others, making it easy to deploy and scale your application.

#### 9\. **Integration with popular services**

It has many integrations with popular services and tools such as CMS (e.g. [Strapi](https://strapi.io/), [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/)), database management systems, and cloud services. This facilitates integration with external systems and extends the framework's capabilities.

## Problems that Next.js solves

#### 1\. **SEO optimization**

When building dynamic applications on React, there was a problem with SEO because the rendering happened on the client. With server-side rendering in Next.js, you can render pages on the server in advance, which helps search engines index the site. This is especially important for projects with a lot of content that needs to be accessible to search engines.

#### 2\. **Performance and loading speed**

Next.js implements a performance optimization system, including code-splitting, resource preloading, and automatic splitting of the page into separate components. This reduces load time and improves user interaction.

#### 3\. **Difficulties with routing configuration**

In a traditional React application, setting up routing requires significant effort. In Next.js, file structure-based routing greatly simplifies the process and eliminates the need to manually configure routes for each page.

#### 4\. **Server logic management**

In Next.js, you can easily create server-side API routes directly in the application, eliminating the need for a separate server to handle requests and simplifying the creation of full-stack applications.

#### 5\. **Need for static generation support**

For sites with a lot of static content (like blogs or news sites), static generation in Next.js helps create fast and SEO-friendly pages, which reduces server load and speeds up site loading.
