## What is React.js?

[React.js](https://react.dev/) is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows you to build dynamic and responsive interfaces by breaking them down into small, reusable components. React focuses on data representation and interface rendering, allowing developers to focus on the functionality and responsiveness of the application.

The main feature of [React.js](https://react.dev/) is the concept of virtual DOM (Document Object Model). Instead of directly interacting with the DOM, React uses the virtual DOM to improve performance. When data in the application changes, the virtual DOM calculates the difference from the current state and applies minimal updates to the real DOM. This approach makes rendering faster and more efficient.

## What problems does React.js solve?

#### 1\.  **State management** 
React simplifies component state management by ensuring that the interface updates efficiently when data changes.
    
#### 2\.  **Component approach**
Allows complex interfaces to be broken down into independent and reusable components, simplifying code maintenance and testing.
    
#### 3\.  **Improved performance**
With a virtual DOM, React optimizes the UI experience by reducing costly operations in the real DOM.
    
#### 4\.  **One-way data flow**
Provides predictability and simplicity of component state management, making debugging much easier.
    
#### 5\.  **Community and ecosystem**
React has a huge community of developers, many out-of-the-box solutions and tools, making it easy to develop and maintain applications.
    
However, despite its advantages, React.js has its limitations and drawbacks, especially when compared to more comprehensive frameworks such as Next.js.

## Disadvantages of React.js

As web applications evolve and their performance and SEO (search engine optimization) requirements increase, simply using React is no longer always enough. This leads to the need to integrate additional tools to ensure application performance.

#### 1\. **SEO problems**

[React.js](https://react.dev/) renders content on the client side, which can be challenging for search engines. To ensure content indexing, you have to use server-side rendering (SSR) or static generation (SSG) technologies. This adds complexity to development, as React does not provide out-of-the-box built-in solutions for these tasks.

#### 2\. **Performance and page load speed**

One of the key issues with React.js is the increase in page load times, especially for large single page applications (SPAs). Content is loaded dynamically, which can create a negative user experience, especially on slow internet connections.

#### 3\. **No built-in routing**

React doesn't have a built-in routing system, which means you need to use external libraries like React Router. This complicates customization and increases the amount of code.

#### 4\. **Support rendering on the server**

React.js does not provide server-side rendering by default. To implement SSR, you need to resort to third-party tools and solutions, which complicates the application architecture.

I prefer [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) in my projects because it solves many of the problems inherent in [React.js](https://react.dev/) and provides tools to quickly develop SEO-optimized websites. Next.js offers powerful features such as server-side rendering and static generation, making it an ideal choice for modern web applications.
